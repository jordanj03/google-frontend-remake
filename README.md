# google-frontend-remake

Basic remake of the frontend for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search
it's not 1:1 and there are some dissimilarities that I'm aware of, for example, not having "images" under the Google logo and advanced search is missing some options on the dropdowns
Made using HTML and SCSS
I also think that the Google logo is not centered on the index or images, however, it's not centered on Google's actual frontend, this is a non-issue for me, might fix later, probably not.
